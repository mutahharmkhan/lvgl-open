LVGL is a bunch of C and header files that you can easily add and compile
in your project.

Writing a custom display and input device from scratch is also easy,
but you can also pick from ready-to-use drivers for LCD peripheries
([ST's LTDC](/integration/chip_vendors/stm32/ltdc), [NXP's eLCDIF](/integration/chip_vendors/nxp/elcdif), etc.),
external display controllers (e.g. [ILI9341](/integration/external_display_controllers/ili9341)),
[SDL](/integration/pc/sdl), [OpenGL](/integration/embedded_linux/drivers/opengl_driver),
[Wayland](/integration/embedded_linux/drivers/wayland), and other [Embedded Linux](/integration/embedded_linux)
frameworks.

All the mainstream RTOS and desktop operating systems are also supported,
including [FreeRTOS](/integration/rtos/freertos), [Zephyr](/integration/rtos/zephyr),
[NuttX](/integration/rtos/nuttx), [Windows](/integration/pc/windows), [Linux](/integration/pc/linux),
[macOS](/integration/pc/macos), etc.

If you are looking for an [Arduino](/integration/frameworks/arduino),
[ESP-IDF](/integration/chip_vendors/espressif), or [PlatformIO](/integration/frameworks/platformio)
guide, you are also covered.

You can also pick a [ready-to-use project](https://lvgl.io/boards) for many
development boards.
