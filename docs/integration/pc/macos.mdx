## Overview

Ready-to-use projects are available to run LVGL on macOS as well.
These projects use the [SDL Driver](/integration/pc/sdl).

## Ready-to-Use Projects

### VSCode

LVGL is available for [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), a well-known cross-platform code editor.

It uses [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) to open a window, show the rendered content, and manage mouse and keyboard.

A ready-to-use LVGL project for VSCode is available at
[https://github.com/lvgl/lv_port_pc_vscode](https://github.com/lvgl/lv_port_pc_vscode).

The project uses [CMake](/integration/building/cmake) to compile LVGL, so it also serves as a CMake example.

This repository also has built-in FreeRTOS integration, making it easy to test the UI
with an embedded OS as well.

### Eclipse

The project for [Eclipse CDT](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.cdt) also uses [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/).
It can be found at
[https://github.com/lvgl/lv_port_pc_eclipse](https://github.com/lvgl/lv_port_pc_eclipse).

The project uses CMake to compile LVGL, so it also serves as a [CMake](/integration/building/cmake) example.
