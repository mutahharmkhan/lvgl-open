## Overview

LVGL comes with a lot of built-in Linux-related drivers and support:

- Wayland, DRM, SDL, and fbdev display drivers
- `pthread` integration
- [CMake](/integration/building/cmake) support

Multiple repositories are available to help you get started easily.
Just follow the README of the repositories listed below.

## Ready-to-Use Projects

### VSCode

LVGL is available for [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), a well-known cross-platform code editor.

It uses [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) to open a window, show the rendered content, and manage mouse and keyboard.

A ready-to-use LVGL project for VSCode is available at
[https://github.com/lvgl/lv_port_pc_vscode](https://github.com/lvgl/lv_port_pc_vscode).

The project uses [CMake](/integration/building/cmake) to compile LVGL, so it also serves as a CMake example.

This repository also has built-in FreeRTOS integration, making it easy to test the UI
with an embedded OS.

### Generic Linux Port

The [lv_port_linux](https://github.com/lvgl/lv_port_linux) project is typically meant to
be used for embedded hardware, but it runs perfectly on PC as well.

It supports all the built-in LVGL drivers in a preconfigured [CMake](/integration/building/cmake) build system,
making it easy to integrate into any platform or environment.

### Eclipse

The project for [Eclipse CDT](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.cdt) also uses [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/).
It can be found at
[https://github.com/lvgl/lv_port_pc_eclipse](https://github.com/lvgl/lv_port_pc_eclipse).

The project uses CMake to compile LVGL, so it also serves as a [CMake](/integration/building/cmake) example.
