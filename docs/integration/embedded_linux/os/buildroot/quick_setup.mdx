Quick Setup
###########

A Git repository is available that includes everything needed to test the
Buildroot setup without following the guide. It is intended for testing
purposes and can be used if you are already familiar with Buildroot concepts
and architecture.

Get the repository

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/lvgl/lv_buildroot.git
```

Build the image

```bash
./build.sh
```

At this point, you have an image that can be flashed on an SD and used.

Now build the SDK and install it

```bash
cd output
make sdk
mkdir -p ~/sdk
tar -xzf images/aarch64-buildroot-linux-gnu_sdk-buildroot.tar.gz -C ~/sdk
```

The SDK is installed. Compile the application.

```bash
cd ../application/lv_benchmark
source ../setup-build-env.sh
cmake -B build -S .
make -j $(nproc) -C build
cd ../..
```

Install the binary in the rootfs_overlay

```bash
cp application/lv_benchmark/bin/lvgl-app resources/board/rootfs_overlay/usr/bin/
```

Regenerate the image with the rootfs overlay updated.

```bash
cd output
make
```

Go to [Flash the image](/integration/embedded_linux/os/buildroot/image_generation) to test the system.
