### Overview

The **EGL** driver provides support for creating LVGL displays using the EGL (Embedded-System Graphics Library) API. 
EGL is a lower-level API that is more closely tied to the underlying drivers of the platform. 
The OpenGL support in LVGL is intended to be portable between different APIs. Currently, there is support for GLFW and EGL. 
Using EGL requires some additional platform integration.

<ApiLink name="lv_opengles_egl_window_create" /> can be used to create a <ApiLink name="lv_opengles_window_t" />
which can be used with the same generic LVGL OpenGL APIs as a GLFW window.

### EGL with DRM

EGL can be used together with the DRM driver for hardware-accelerated rendering.

When <ApiLink name="LV_USE_OPENGLES" /> is enabled, the DRM driver will automatically set up EGL.
No additional initialization is required beyond the normal DRM setup.

See [DRM](/integration/embedded_linux/drivers/drm) for configuration and a basic usage example.

### EGL without DRM (Experimental)

<Callout type="warn">
This feature is experimental and the API is private. Expect breaking changes.
</Callout>

If you want to use EGL without being tied to DRM, you can enable <ApiLink name="LV_USE_EGL" /> using a compiler definition.
This API is currently private and experimental, and people should expect breaking changes.

```bash
# Enable standalone EGL (experimental)
-DLV_USE_EGL=1
```

This allows you to use EGL with your own context management or other platforms, but the API may change 
without notice in future versions.

### Improving Performance

There is a renderer in LVGL which caches software-rendered areas as OpenGL textures.
See [OpenGL Texture Caching Renderer](/integration/embedded_linux/drivers/opengl_driver) to learn more about it.
