### What is RT-Thread?

[RT-Thread](https://www.rt-thread.io/) is an [open
source](https://github.com/RT-Thread/rt-thread), neutral, and
community-based real-time operating system (RTOS). RT-Thread has
**Standard version** and **Nano version**. For resource-constrained
microcontroller (MCU) systems, the Nano version that requires only 3 KB
Flash and 1.2 KB RAM memory resources can be tailored with easy-to-use
tools. For resource-rich IoT devices, RT-Thread can use the **online
software package** management tool, together with system configuration
tools, to achieve intuitive and rapid modular cutting, seamlessly import
rich software packages; thus, achieving complex functions like Android's
graphical interface and touch sliding effects, smart voice interaction
effects, and so on.

##### Key features

- Designed for resource-constrained devices, the minimum kernel
   requires only 1.2KB of RAM and 3 KB of Flash.
- A variety of standard interfaces, such as POSIX, CMSIS, C++
   application environment.
- Has rich components and a prosperous and fast growing [package ecosystem](https://packages.rt-thread.org/en/)
- Elegant code style, easy to use, read and master.
- High Scalability. RT-Thread has high-quality scalable software
   architecture, loose coupling, modularity, is easy to tailor and
   expand.
- Supports high-performance applications.
- Supports all mainstream compiling tools such as GCC, Keil and IAR.
- Supports a wide range of [architectures and chips](https://www.rt-thread.io/board.html)

### How to run LVGL on RT-Thread?

[中文文档](https://www.rt-thread.org/document/site/#/rt-thread-version/rt-thread-standard/packages-manual/lvgl-docs/introduction)

LVGL has registered as a
[softwarepackage](https://packages.rt-thread.org/en/detail.html?package=LVGL)
of RT-Thread. By using
[Env tool](https://www.rt-thread.io/download.html?download=Env) or
[RT-Thread Studio IDE](https://www.rt-thread.io/download.html?download=Studio),
RT-Thread users can easily download LVGL source code and combine with
RT-Thread project.

RT-Thread community has port LVGL to several Board-Support Packages (BSPs):

| BSP | BSP |
