## IOT AIOT Smart Displays

The Viewe IOT AIOT Smart Displays are a series of displays that use ESP32
microcontrollers with integrated multi-modal interactions of GUI/voice/camera, ML/AI
edge computing, and seamless connectivity. UART/RS232/RS485/CAN Interfaces and
redundant IO interfaces are included to facilitate extended usage. LVGL/Arduino/ESP-IDF
is well-suited to these boards.
