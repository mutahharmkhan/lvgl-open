There are several good ways ways to gain deeper knowledge of LVGL.  Here is one
recommended order of documents to read and things to play with while you are
advancing your knowledge:

1. If not already read, start with [Introduction](/introduction) page of
   the documentation.  (5 minutes)
2. Check out the Online Demos to see LVGL in action.  (3 minutes)
3. If not already done, read the [Learn the Basics](/getting_started/learn_the_basics) (above).  (15 minutes)
4. Set up an LVGL [Running on PC](/integration/pc).  (10 minutes)
5. Have a look at some [Examples](/examples) and their code.
6. [Integration Overview](/integration/overview) or check out
   the ready-to-use Projects.
7. Read the [Main Modules](/main-modules) pages to get a better understanding of the library. (2-3 hours)
8. Skim the documentation of [All Widgets](/widgets) to see what is available.
9. If you have questions go to the Forum.
10. Read the [Contributing](/contributing) guide to see how you can help to improve LVGL. (15 minutes)
