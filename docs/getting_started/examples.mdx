Below are several basic examples.  They include the application code that produces
the Widget Tree needed to make LVGL render the examples shown.  Each example assumes
LVGL has undergone normal initialization, meaning that a `lv_display_t` object
was created and therefore has an [Active Screen](/common-widget-features/screens).

### A very simple *hello world* label

<LvglExample name="lv_example_get_started_1" path="get_started/lv_example_get_started_1" />

### A button with a label and react on click event

<LvglExample name="lv_example_get_started_2" path="get_started/lv_example_get_started_2" />

### Create styles from scratch for buttons

<LvglExample name="lv_example_get_started_3" path="get_started/lv_example_get_started_3" />

### Create a slider and write its value on a label

<LvglExample name="lv_example_get_started_4" path="get_started/lv_example_get_started_4" />
