When the term "layer" is used in LVGL documentation, it may refer to one of several
things:

1. For Widgets, the [Order of Creation](/common-widget-features/layers) creates a natural layering (Z-order) of
    Widgets sharing the same parent.
2. In the context of pixel rendering (drawing), there are [Draw Layers](/main-modules/draw/draw_layers).
3. Permanent [Screen Layers](/main-modules/display/screen_layers) are part of each [Display (lv_display)](/main-modules/display) object.

#1 is covered below.  #2 and #3 are covered in [Draw Layers](/main-modules/draw/draw_layers) and
[Screen Layers](/main-modules/display/screen_layers) respectively.

## Order of Creation

By default, LVGL draws new Widgets on top of old Widgets.

For example, assume we add a button to a parent Widget named button1 and
then another button named button2. Then button1 (along with its child
Widget(s)) will be in the background and can be covered by button2 and
its children.

```c
/* Create a screen */
lv_obj_t * scr = lv_obj_create(NULL);
lv_screen_load(scr);          /* Load the screen */

/* Create 2 buttons */
lv_obj_t * btn1 = lv_button_create(scr);     /* Create the first button on the screen */
lv_obj_set_pos(btn1, 60, 40);                /* Set the position of the first button */

lv_obj_t * btn2 = lv_button_create(scr);     /* Create the second button on the screen */
lv_obj_set_pos(btn2, 180, 80);               /* Set the position of the second button */

/* Add labels to the buttons */
lv_obj_t * label1 = lv_label_create(btn1);   /* Create a label on the first button */
lv_label_set_text(label1, "Button 1");       /* Set the text of the label */

lv_obj_t * label2 = lv_label_create(btn2);   /* Create a label on the second button */
lv_label_set_text(label2, "Button 2");       /* Set the text of the label */

/* Delete the second label */
lv_obj_delete(label2);
```

### Changing Order

There are three explicit ways to change a Widget's layer position (Z-order) among
Widgets that share the same parent:

- Use <ApiLink name="lv_obj_move_to_index" display="lv_obj_move_to_index(widget, idx)" /> to move a Widget to a new index.
  
  :0:                Background
  :child_count - 1:  Foreground
  :&lt; 0:              Count down from the top (-1 = topmost).
  :lv_obj_get_index(widget) - 1:  Move down 1 layer.
  :lv_obj_get_index(widget) + 1:  Move up 1 layer.
- Use <ApiLink name="lv_obj_swap" display="lv_obj_swap(widget1, widget2)" /> to swap the layer positions (Z-orders)
  of the two Widgets.
- When <ApiLink name="lv_obj_set_parent" display="lv_obj_set_parent(widget, new_parent)" /> is used, `widget` will
  become the foremost child of `new_parent`.

## API

<ApiLinkList items={["lv_obj_tree"]} />
