Software emulation of RISC-V Vector Extension (RVV 1.0) intrinsics

This header provides pure C implementations of RVV intrinsics to enable testing and verification on non-RVV platforms. The implementations follow the RVV specification as documented in: [https://dzaima.github.io/intrinsics-viewer/](https://dzaima.github.io/intrinsics-viewer/)

Usage:
1. On systems without RVV support, include this header BEFORE \<riscv_vector.h>
2. Or define RISCV_VECTOR_EMULATION before including actual \<riscv_vector.h>
3. All __riscv_* functions will be emulated in software

Limitations:
- No performance optimization (this is software emulation)
- Vector length (vl) is tracked but all operations work on single elements in a loop
- Predication and masking are simplified but functionally correct
- LMUL \< 1 (fractional multipliers) are not supported
