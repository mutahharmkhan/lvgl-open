## Overview

The Spangroup Widget is used to display rich text.  Different
from the Label Widget, Spangroups can render text styled with
different fonts, colors, and sizes into the Spangroup Widget.
See example below.

A Spangroup contains 0 or more Span Descriptors ("Spans").  Each Span contains its
own text and style properties for that text.  You add 1 Span (as a child) to the
Spangroup for each "span" of uniquely-styled text needed.  Each Span so added is
appended to the end of the list.  The list sequence determines the order in which the
Spans are displayed.  Spans can be added to, and removed from, the Spangroup
throughout its life.  The number of Spans that can be added is limited only by
available RAM.

## Parts and Styles

- <ApiLink name="LV_PART_MAIN" /> Spangroup has only one part.

## Usage

### Set text and style

Add each needed Span to a Spangroup like this:

```c
lv_span_t * span = lv_spangroup_new_span(spangroup);
```

After a Span is created, use the following functions to set its text
and style properties:

- <ApiLink name="lv_span_set_text" display="lv_span_set_text(span, &quot;text&quot;)" />
- <ApiLink name="lv_style_set_" display="lv_style_set_<property_name>(&span->style, value)" />

Example of the latter:  <ApiLink name="lv_style_set_text_color" display="lv_style_set_text_color(&span->style, lv_palette_main(LV_PALETTE_RED))" />.

If the Spangroup Widget's `mode != LV_SPAN_MODE_FIXED` call
<ApiLink name="lv_spangroup_refr_mode" display="lv_spangroup_refr_mode(spangroup)" /> after you have modifying any of its
Spans to ensure it is redrawn appropriately.

### Retrieving a Span child

Spangroups store their children differently from normal Widgets, so
normal functions for getting children won't work.

<ApiLink name="lv_spangroup_get_child" display="lv_spangroup_get_child(spangroup, id)" /> will return a pointer to the
child Span at index `id`. In addition, `id` can be negative to index
from the end of the Spangroup where `-1` is the youngest child, `-2`
is second youngest, etc.

E.g. `lv_span_t * span = lv_spangroup_get_child(spangroup, 0)` will
return the first child of the Spangroup.
`lv_span_t * span = lv_spangroup_get_child(spangroup, -1)` will return
the last (or most recent) child.

### Child count

Use <ApiLink name="lv_spangroup_get_span_count" display="lv_spangroup_get_span_count(spangroup)" /> to get
the number of contained Spans.

E.g. `uint32_t size = lv_spangroup_get_span_count(spangroup)`

### Removing a Span

You can remove a Span at any time during the Spangroup's life using the function
<ApiLink name="lv_spangroup_delete_span" display="lv_spangroup_delete_span(spangroup, span)" />.

### Text align

Like the Label Widget, a Spangroup can be set to one the following text-alignment modes:

- <ApiLink name="LV_TEXT_ALIGN_LEFT" /> Align text to left.
- <ApiLink name="LV_TEXT_ALIGN_CENTER" /> Center text.
- <ApiLink name="LV_TEXT_ALIGN_RIGHT" /> Align text to right edge.
- <ApiLink name="LV_TEXT_ALIGN_AUTO" /> Align auto.

Use function <ApiLink name="lv_spangroup_set_align" display="lv_spangroup_set_align(spangroup, LV_TEXT_ALIGN_...)" />
to set text alignment.

### Modes

**DEPRECATED**, set the width to <ApiLink name="LV_SIZE_CONTENT" /> or fixed value to control expanding/wrapping.

A Spangroup can be set to one the following modes:

- <ApiLink name="LV_SPAN_MODE_FIXED" /> Fixes its size.
- <ApiLink name="LV_SPAN_MODE_EXPAND" /> Expand size to text size but stay on one line.
- <ApiLink name="LV_SPAN_MODE_BREAK" /> Keep width; break lines that are too long and auto-expand height.

Use <ApiLink name="lv_spangroup_set_mode" display="lv_spangroup_set_mode(spangroup, LV_SPAN_MODE_BREAK)" /> to set its mode.

### Overflow

A Spangroup can be set to handle text overflow in one of the following ways:

- <ApiLink name="LV_SPAN_OVERFLOW_CLIP" /> truncates text at the limit of the area.
- <ApiLink name="LV_SPAN_OVERFLOW_ELLIPSIS" /> display an ellipsis (`...`) when text overflows the area.

Use <ApiLink name="lv_spangroup_set_overflow" display="lv_spangroup_set_overflow(spangroup, LV_SPAN_OVERFLOW_CLIP)" /> to set
the Spangroup's overflow mode.

### First line indent

Use <ApiLink name="lv_spangroup_set_indent" display="lv_spangroup_set_indent(spangroup, 20)" /> to set the indent of the
first line. All modes support pixel units. In addition, <ApiLink name="LV_SPAN_MODE_FIXED" />
and <ApiLink name="LV_SPAN_MODE_BREAK" /> modes support percentage units as well
(e.g. `lv_pct(10)`).

### Lines

Use <ApiLink name="lv_spangroup_set_max_lines" display="lv_spangroup_set_max_lines(spangroup, 10)" /> to set the maximum number
of lines to be displayed in <ApiLink name="LV_SPAN_MODE_BREAK" /> mode. A negative
value indicates no limit.

### Data binding

To get familiar with observers, subjects, and data bindings in general, visit the
[Observer](/main-modules/observer/observer) page.

Very similar to Label-text binding, a Span's text can be bound to a subject as well.

The only difference is that in the bind function both the Spangroup and the Span need to be specified:

<ApiLink name="lv_spangroup_bind_span_text" display="lv_spangroup_bind_span_text(spangroup, span1, &subject, format_string)" />

Note that before calling <ApiLink name="lv_spangroup_delete_span" />, <ApiLink name="lv_observer_remove" />
needs to be called manually as LVGL can't remove the binding automatically.
