## Overview

LEDs are rectangle-like (or circle) Widgets whose brightness can be
adjusted. With lower brightness the color of the LED becomes darker.

## Parts and Styles

- <ApiLink name="LV_LED_PART_MAIN" /> uses the [typical background style
  properties](/common-widget-features/styles/overview).

## Usage

### Color

You can set the color of the LED with
<ApiLink name="lv_led_set_color" display="lv_led_set_color(led, lv_color_hex(0xff0080))" />. This will be used as its
background color, border color, and shadow color.

### Brightness

You can set their brightness with <ApiLink name="lv_led_set_brightness" display="lv_led_set_brightness(led, brightness)" />.
The `brightness` value should be in the range 0 (darkest) to 255 (lightest).

### Toggle

Use <ApiLink name="lv_led_on" display="lv_led_on(led)" /> and <ApiLink name="lv_led_off" display="lv_led_off(led)" /> to set the brightness to
a predefined ON or OFF value. The <ApiLink name="lv_led_toggle" display="lv_led_toggle(led)" /> toggles between
the ON and OFF state.

You can set custom LED ON and OFF brightness values by defining macros
<ApiLink name="LV_LED_BRIGHT_MAX" /> and <ApiLink name="LV_LED_BRIGHT_MIN" /> in your project.  Their default
values are 255 and 80. These too must be in the range [0..255].
