## Overview

The Line Widget is capable of drawing straight lines between a set of
points.

## Parts and Styles

- <ApiLink name="LV_PART_MAIN" /> uses the [typical background](/common-widget-features/styles/overview)
   and line style properties.

## Usage

### Set points

A Line's points have to be stored in an <ApiLink name="lv_point_precise_t" /> array and passed to
the Widget by the <ApiLink name="lv_line_set_points" display="lv_line_set_points(lines, point_array, point_cnt)" />
function.

Their coordinates can either be specified as raw pixel coordinates
(e.g. `{5, 10}`), or as a percentage of the Line's bounding box using
<ApiLink name="lv_pct" display="lv_pct(x)" />. In the latter case, the Line's width/height may need to
be set explicitly using <ApiLink name="lv_obj_set_width" /> and <ApiLink name="lv_obj_set_height" />,
as percentage values do not automatically expand the bounding box.

### Auto-size

By default, the Line's width and height are set to <ApiLink name="LV_SIZE_CONTENT" />.
This means it will automatically set its size to fit all the points. If
the size is set explicitly, parts on the Line may not be visible.

### Invert y

By default, the *y == 0* point is at the top of the Widget. It might be
counterintuitive in some cases, so the y coordinates can be inverted
with <ApiLink name="lv_line_set_y_invert" display="lv_line_set_y_invert(line, true)" />. In this case, *y == 0* will
be at the bottom of the Widget. *y invert* is disabled by default.
