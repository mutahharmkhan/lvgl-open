## Overview

The Tile View is a container Widget whose elements (called *tiles*) can
be arranged in grid form. A user can navigate between the tiles by
swiping. Any direction of swiping can be disabled on the tiles
individually to not allow moving from one tile to another.

If the Tile View is screen sized, the user interface resembles what you
may have seen on smartwatches.

## Parts and Styles

The Tile View is built from a [base widget](/widgets/base_widget) container and
[base widget](/widgets/base_widget) tiles.

The parts and styles work the same as for [base widget](/widgets/base_widget).

## Usage

### Add a tile

<ApiLink name="lv_tileview_add_tile" display="lv_tileview_add_tile(tileview, col_id, row_id, dir)" /> creates a new
tile on the `col_id`-th column and `row_id`-th row. `dir` can be
`LV_DIR_LEFT/RIGHT/TOP/BOTTOM/HOR/VER/ALL` or OR-ed values to enable
moving to the adjacent tiles in the given direction by swiping.

The returned value is a pointer to the tile (a [base widget](/widgets/base_widget)) on which the
content of the tab can be created.

### Change tile

The Tile View can scroll to a specified tile with
<ApiLink name="lv_tileview_set_tile" display="lv_tileview_set_tile(tileview, tile, LV_ANIM_ON/OFF)" /> or
<ApiLink name="lv_tileview_set_tile_by_index" display="lv_tileview_set_tile_by_index(tileview, col_id, row_id, LV_ANIM_ON/OFF)" />.

## Events

- <ApiLink name="LV_EVENT_VALUE_CHANGED" /> Sent after a new tile is displayed by scrolling.
   <ApiLink name="lv_tileview_get_tile_active" display="lv_tileview_get_tile_active(tileview)" /> can be used within the event to
   get a pointer to the newly-displayed tile.
