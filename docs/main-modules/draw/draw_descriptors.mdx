title: Draw Descriptors
---

<br />

<hr />

## Overview

Each [Draw Task](/main-modules/draw/draw_pipeline) type has its own draw descriptor type.  For
example, <ApiLink name="lv_draw_label_dsc_t" /> is used for label drawing,
<ApiLink name="lv_draw_image_dsc_t" /> is used for image drawing.

When an `lv_draw_...` function is called, it creates a Draw Task, copies the draw
descriptor into a `malloc`ed memory block, and frees it automatically when
needed.  Therefore, local draw descriptor variables can be safely used.

## Relation to Styles

In most cases, style properties map 1-to-1 to draw descriptor fields.  For example:

- `label_dsc.color` corresponds to the `text_color` style property.
- `shadow_dsc.width`, `line_dsc.opa`, and `arc_dsc.width` map to
  `shadow_width`, `line_opa`, and `arc_width` in styles.

See [Style Properties](/common-widget-features/styles/style-properties) to see the list of style properties and what they mean.

## Base Draw Descriptor

In each draw descriptor there is a generic "base descriptor" with
<ApiLink name="lv_draw_dsc_base_t" /> type and with `base` in its name.  For example
`label_dsc.base`.  This `struct` stores useful information about which Widget
and part created the draw descriptor.  See all the fields in
<ApiLink name="lv_draw_dsc_base_t" />.

In an <ApiLink name="LV_EVENT_DRAW_TASK_ADDED" /> event, the elements of the base draw
descriptor are very useful to identify the Draw Task.  For example:

```c
/* In LV_EVENT_DRAW_TASK_ADDED */
lv_draw_task_t * t = lv_event_get_draw_task(e);
lv_draw_base_dsc_t * draw_dsc = lv_draw_task_get_draw_dsc(t);
draw_dsc.obj;  /* The Widget for which the draw descriptor was created */
draw_dsc.part; /* The Widget part for which the draw descriptor was created
                  E.g. LV_PART_INDICATOR */
draw_dsc.id1;  /* A Widget type specific ID (e.g. table row index).
                  See the docs of the given Widget. */
draw_dsc.id2;

draw_dsc.layer; /* The target layer.
                   Required when a new Draw Tasks are also created */
```

### Simple Initialization

Before using a draw descriptor it needs to be initialized with
the related function.  For example, <ApiLink name="lv_draw_label_dsc_init" display="lv_draw_label_dsc_init(&my_label_draw_dsc)" />.

After initialization, each field of the draw descriptor can be set. The default
values are quite sane and reasonable, so usually only a few fields need modification.
For example:

```c
/* In LV_EVENT_DRAW_MAIN */
lv_draw_label_dsc_t my_label_draw_dsc;
lv_draw_label_dsc_init(&my_label_draw_dsc);
my_label_draw_dsc.font = &my_font;
my_label_draw_dsc.color = lv_color_hex(0xff0000);
my_label_draw_dsc.text = "Hello";

lv_area_t a = {10, 10, 200, 50}; /* Draw label here */

lv_draw_label(lv_event_get_layer(e), &my_label_draw_dsc, &a);
```

### Initialization for Widgets

When rendering a part of a Widget, helper functions can initialize draw
descriptors based on the styles, and a specific Widget part in the current state.

For example:

```c
/* In LV_EVENT_DRAW_MAIN */
lv_draw_rect_dsc_t cur_dsc;
lv_draw_rect_dsc_init(&cur_dsc);
lv_obj_init_draw_rect_dsc(obj, LV_PART_CURSOR, &cur_dsc);
cur_dsc.fill_color = lv_color_hex(0xff0000); /* Modify if needed */
lv_draw_rect(layer, &cur_dsc, &area);
```

The `lv_obj_init_draw_...` functions automatically initialize the fields of
the base descriptor.

### Modify the draw descriptors

In <ApiLink name="LV_EVENT_DRAW_TASK_ADDED" />, the draw descriptor of the `draw_task` can be
accessed (using <ApiLink name="lv_draw_task_get_label_dsc" /> and similar functions)
and modified (to change color, text, font, etc.).  This means that in
<ApiLink name="LV_EVENT_DRAW_TASK_ADDED" />, the `draw_task`s and draw descriptors
are already initialized and it's enough to change only a few specific values.

For example:

```c
/* In LV_EVENT_DRAW_TASK_ADDED */
lv_draw_task_t * t = lv_event_get_draw_task(e);
lv_draw_label_dsc_t * draw_dsc = lv_draw_task_get_label_dsc(t);

/* Check a few things in `draw_dsc->base` */

/* Make the color lighter for longer texts */
draw_dsc->color = lv_color_lighten(draw_dsc->color,
                                   LV_MIN(lv_strlen(draw_dsc->text) * 5, 255));

/* Create new Draw Tasks if needed by calling
 * `lv_draw_...(draw_dsc->base.layer, ...)` functions */
```

## Rectangle Draw Descriptor

<ApiLink name="lv_draw_rect_dsc_t" /> is a helper descriptor that combines:

- Fill
- Border
- Outline (a border with its own styles)
- Shadow
- Background image (an image with its own styles)

into a single call.

`lv_obj_init_draw_rect_dsc(obj, part, &dsc);` initializes a draw descriptor
from a Widget, and `lv_draw_rect(layer, &dsc, area)` draws the rectangle in a
specified area.

<LvglExample name="lv_example_canvas_3" path="widgets/canvas/lv_example_canvas_3" />

## Fill Draw Descriptor

The main fields of <ApiLink name="lv_draw_fill_dsc_t" /> are straightforward.  It has a
radius, opacity, and color to draw a rectangle.  If opacity is 0, no draw task will
be created.

- <ApiLink name="lv_draw_fill_dsc_init" display="lv_draw_fill_dsc_init(&dsc)" /> initializes a fill Draw Task.
- <ApiLink name="lv_draw_sw_fill" display="lv_draw_sw_fill(layer, &dsc, area)" /> creates a Draw Task to fill an area.
- <ApiLink name="lv_draw_task_get_fill_dsc" display="lv_draw_task_get_fill_dsc(draw_task)" /> retrieves the fill descriptor from
  a Draw Task.

## Gradients

The `grad` field of the fill descriptor (or <ApiLink name="lv_grad_dsc_t" /> in general)
supports:

- Horizontal
- Vertical
- Skew
- Radial
- Conical

gradient types.

The following show some example gradients.

<LvglExample name="lv_example_style_2" path="styles/lv_example_style_2" />

<LvglExample name="lv_example_style_17" path="styles/lv_example_style_17" />

<LvglExample name="lv_example_style_18" path="styles/lv_example_style_18" />

<LvglExample name="lv_example_style_19" path="styles/lv_example_style_19" />

For each gradient type, multiple color and opacity values can be assigned.  These are
called "stops".  The maximum number of stops is limited to
<ApiLink name="LV_GRADIENT_MAX_STOPS" />.

A gradient is basically a transition of colors and opacities between stops.

Besides just setting the color and opacity of each stop, it is also possible to set
where they start relative to the whole gradient area.

For example with 3 stops it can be set like this:

- 10% red: 0--10% fully red
- 60% green: 10--60% transition from red to green, 60% is fully green
- 65% blue: fast transition from green to blue between 60%--65%. After 65% fully blue.

The position of the stops are called fractions or offsets and are 8 bit values where
0 is 0% and 255 is 100% of the whole gradient area.

<ApiLink name="lv_grad_init_stops" display="lv_grad_init_stops(grad_dsc, colors, opas, fracs, cnt)" /> initializes
a gradient descriptor with stops containing the color, opacity and fraction of each
stop.

```c
static const lv_color_t colors[2] = {
    LV_COLOR_MAKE(0xe8, 0xe8, 0xe8),
    LV_COLOR_MAKE(0x79, 0x79, 0x79),
};

static const lv_opa_t opas[2] = {
    170,
    255,
};

static const uint8_t fracs[2] = {
    170,
    255,
};

lv_grad_init_stops(&grad, colors, opas, fracs, sizeof(colors) / sizeof(lv_color_t));
```

If the opacity array is `NULL` 255 will be used for each stop.  If the fractions
array is `NULL` the colors will be distributed evenly.  For example with 3 colors:
0%, 50%, 100%

### Padding

Linear, radial, and conic gradients are defined between two points or angles.  You
can define how to pad the areas outside of the start and end points or angles:

- <ApiLink name="LV_GRAD_EXTEND_PAD" />: Repeat the same color
- <ApiLink name="LV_GRAD_EXTEND_REPEAT" />: Repeat the pattern
- <ApiLink name="LV_GRAD_EXTEND_REFLECT" />: Repeat the pattern normally and mirrored alternately

### Horizontal and Vertical Gradients

The simplest and usually fastest gradient types are horizontal and vertical gradients.

After initializing the stops with <ApiLink name="lv_grad_init_stops" /> call either
<ApiLink name="lv_grad_horizontal_init" display="lv_grad_horizontal_init(&grad_dsc)" /> or
<ApiLink name="lv_grad_vertical_init" display="lv_grad_vertical_init(&grad_dsc)" /> to get a horizontal or vertical gradient
descriptor.

<LvglExample name="lv_example_grad_1" path="grad/lv_example_grad_1" />

### Linear Gradients

The linear (or skew) gradient are similar to horizontal or vertical gradient but the
angle of the gradient can be controlled.

The linear gradient will be rendered along a line defined by 2 points.

After initializing the stops with <ApiLink name="lv_grad_init_stops" /> call
<ApiLink name="lv_grad_linear_init" display="lv_grad_linear_init(&grad_dsc, from_x, from_y, to_x, to_y, LV_GRAD_EXTEND_...)" />
with your point values and extend pattern strategy to get a linear gradient descriptor.

<LvglExample name="lv_example_grad_2" path="grad/lv_example_grad_2" />

### Radial Gradients

The radial gradient is described by two circles: an outer circle and an inner circle
(also called the focal point).  The gradient will be calculated between the focal
point's circle and the edge of the outer circle.

If the center of the focal point and the center of the main circle are the same, the
gradient will spread evenly in all directions.  If the center points are not the
same, the gradient will have an egg shape.

The focal point's circle should be inside the main circle.

After initializing the stops with <ApiLink name="lv_grad_init_stops" />, the outer
circle can be set by:
<ApiLink name="lv_grad_radial_init" display="lv_grad_radial_init(&grad_dsc, center_x, center_y, edge_x, edge_y, LV_GRAD_EXTEND_...)" />

For both the center and edge coordinates, `px` or `lv_pct()` values can be used.

The inner circle (focal point) can be set with:
<ApiLink name="lv_grad_radial_set_focal" display="lv_grad_radial_set_focal(&grad_dsc, center_x, center_y, radius)" />

<LvglExample name="lv_example_grad_3" path="grad/lv_example_grad_3" />

### Conic Gradients

The conic gradient is defined between two angles within a circle, and colors are mapped
to each angle.

After initializing the stops with <ApiLink name="lv_grad_init_stops" />, the conic gradient
can be set up with:
<ApiLink name="lv_grad_conical_init" display="lv_grad_conical_init(&grad, center_x, center_y, angle_start, angle_end, LV_GRAD_EXTEND_...)" />

For both the center and edge coordinates, `px` or `lv_pct()` values can be used.

The zero angle is on the right-hand side, and 90 degrees is at the bottom.

<LvglExample name="lv_example_grad_4" path="grad/lv_example_grad_4" />

## Border Draw Descriptor

The <ApiLink name="lv_draw_border_dsc_t" /> border descriptor has radius, opacity,
width, color, and side fields.  If the opacity or width is 0, no Draw Task will
be created.

`side` can contain ORed values of <ApiLink name="lv_border_side_t" />, such as
<ApiLink name="LV_BORDER_SIDE_BOTTOM" />.  <ApiLink name="LV_BORDER_SIDE_ALL" />
applies to all sides, while <ApiLink name="LV_BORDER_SIDE_INTERNAL" /> is used by
higher layers (e.g. a table Widget) to calculate border sides.  However, the drawing
routine receives only simpler values.

The following functions are used for border drawing:

- <ApiLink name="lv_draw_border_dsc_init" display="lv_draw_border_dsc_init(&dsc)" /> initializes a border Draw Task.
- <ApiLink name="lv_draw_sw_border" display="lv_draw_sw_border(layer, &dsc, area)" /> creates a Draw Task to draw a border
  inward from its area.
- <ApiLink name="lv_draw_task_get_border_dsc" display="lv_draw_task_get_border_dsc(draw_task)" /> retrieves the border descriptor
  from a Draw Task.

<LvglExample name="lv_example_style_3" path="styles/lv_example_style_3" />

## Outlines

The outline is similar to the border but is drawn outside the object's draw area.

In practice, there is no dedicated outline descriptor like
`lv_draw_outline_dsc_t`, because from the rendering perspective, the
outline is simply another border rendered outside the object's bounds.

The outline is used only in <ApiLink name="lv_draw_rect_dsc_t" /> for convenience. The two
differences compared to borders in <ApiLink name="lv_draw_rect_dsc_t" /> are:

- There is an `outline_pad` property to specify the gap between the target area and
  the inner side of the outline. It can be negative. For example, if `outline_pad =
  -width`, the outline will resemble a border.
- There is no `border_side` property for the outline. It's always rendered as a
  full rectangle.

<LvglExample name="lv_example_style_4" path="styles/lv_example_style_4" />

## Box Shadow Draw Descriptor

The <ApiLink name="lv_draw_box_shadow_dsc_t" /> box shadow descriptor describes a
**rounded rectangle-shaped shadow**.  It cannot generate shadows for arbitrary
shapes, text, or images.  It includes the following fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `radius` | Radius, <ApiLink name="LV_RADIUS_CIRCLE" />. |
| `color` | Shadow color. |
| `width` | Shadow width (blur radius). |
| `spread` | Expands the rectangle in all directions; can be negative. |
| `ofs_x` | Horizontal offset. |
| `ofs_y` | Vertical offset. |
| `opa` | Opacity (0--255 range). Values like <ApiLink name="LV_OPA_TRANSP" />, <ApiLink name="LV_OPA_10" />, etc., can also be used. |
| `bg_cover` | Set to 1 if the background will cover the shadow (a hint for the renderer to skip masking). |

Note: Rendering large shadows may be slow or memory-intensive.

The following functions are used for box shadow drawing:

- <ApiLink name="lv_draw_box_shadow_dsc_init" display="lv_draw_box_shadow_dsc_init(&dsc)" /> initializes a box shadow Draw Task.
- <ApiLink name="lv_draw_sw_box_shadow" display="lv_draw_sw_box_shadow(layer, &dsc, area)" /> creates a Draw Task for a rectangle's
  shadow. The shadow's size and position depend on the width, spread, and offset.
- <ApiLink name="lv_draw_task_get_box_shadow_dsc" display="lv_draw_task_get_box_shadow_dsc(draw_task)" /> retrieves the box shadow
  descriptor from a Draw Task.

<LvglExample name="lv_example_style_5" path="styles/lv_example_style_5" />

## Image Draw Descriptor

The <ApiLink name="lv_draw_image_dsc_t" /> image descriptor defines the parameters for
image drawing.  It is a complex descriptor with the following options:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `src` | The image source, either a pointer to `lv_image_dsc_t` or a file path. |
| `opa` | Opacity in the 0--255 range. Options like <ApiLink name="LV_OPA_TRANSP" />, <ApiLink name="LV_OPA_10" />, etc., can also be used. |
| `clip_radius` | Clips the corners of the image with this radius. Use `LV_RADIUS_CIRCLE` for the maximum radius. |
| `rotation` | Image rotation in 0.1-degree units (e.g., 234 means 23.4°). |
| `scale_x` | Horizontal scaling (zoom) of the image. 256 (LV_SCALE_NONE) means no zoom, 512 doubles the size, and 128 halves it. |
| `scale_y` | Same as `scale_x` but for vertical scaling. |
| `skew_x` | Horizontal skew (parallelogram-like transformation) in 0.1-degree units (e.g., 456 means 45.6°). |
| `skew_y` | Vertical skew, similar to `skew_x`. |
| `pivot` | The pivot point for transformations (scaling and rotation). (0,0) is the top-left corner of the image and can be set outside the image. |
| `bitmap_mask_src` | Pointer to an A8 or L8 image descriptor used to mask the image. The mask is always center-aligned. |
| `recolor` | Mixes this color with the image. For <ApiLink name="LV_COLOR_FORMAT_A8" />, this will be the visible pixels' color. |
| `recolor_opa` | Intensity of recoloring (0 means no recoloring, 255 means full cover). |
| `blend_mode` | Defines how to blend image pixels with the background. See <ApiLink name="lv_blend_mode_t" /> for more details. |
| `antialias` | Set to 1 to enable anti-aliasing for transformations. |
| `tile` | Tiles the image (repeats it both horizontally and vertically) if the image is smaller than the `image_area` field in `lv_draw_image_dsc_t`. |
| `image_area` | Indicates the original, non-clipped area where the image is drawn. This is essential for: 1. Layer rendering, where only part of a layer may be rendered and `clip_radius` needs the original image dimensions. 2. Tiling, where the draw area is larger than the image. |
| `sup` | Internal field to store information about the palette or color of A8 images. |

Functions for image drawing:

- <ApiLink name="lv_draw_image_dsc_init" display="lv_draw_image_dsc_init(&dsc)" /> initializes an image draw descriptor.
- <ApiLink name="lv_draw_image" display="lv_draw_image(layer, &dsc, area)" /> creates a task to draw an image in a given area.
- <ApiLink name="lv_draw_task_get_image_dsc" display="lv_draw_task_get_image_dsc(draw_task)" /> retrieves the image descriptor from a task.

<LvglExample name="lv_example_canvas_6" path="widgets/canvas/lv_example_canvas_6" />

<LvglExample name="lv_example_style_6" path="styles/lv_example_style_6" />

### Layers - Special Images

Layers are treated as images, so an <ApiLink name="lv_draw_image_dsc_t" /> can describe
how layers are blended into their parent layers. All image features apply to
layers as well.

`lv_draw_layer(layer, &dsc, area)` initializes the blending of a layer back to
its parent layer. Additionally, image-drawing-related functions can be used for
layers.

For more details, see [Layers](/common-widget-features/layers).

## Label Draw Descriptor

The <ApiLink name="lv_draw_label_dsc_t" /> label descriptor provides extensive options
for controlling text rendering:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `text` | The text to render. |
| `font` | Font to use, with support for fallback fonts. |
| `color` | Text color. |
| `opa` | Text opacity. |
| `line_space` | Additional space between lines. |
| `letter_space` | Additional space between characters. |
| `ofs_x` | Horizontal text offset. |
| `ofs_y` | Vertical text offset. |
| `sel_start` | Index of the first character for selection (character index, not byte index, since some characters can be multi-byte characters). <ApiLink name="LV_DRAW_LABEL_NO_TXT_SEL" /> means no selection. |
| `sel_end` | Index of the last character for selection. |
| `sel_color` | Color of selected characters. |
| `sel_bg_color` | Background color for selected characters. |
| `align` | Text alignment. See <ApiLink name="lv_text_align_t" />. |
| `bidi_dir` | Base direction for right-to-left text rendering (e.g., Arabic). See <ApiLink name="lv_base_dir_t" />. |
| `decor` | Text decoration, e.g., underline. See <ApiLink name="lv_text_decor_t" />. |
| `flag` | Flags for text rendering. See <ApiLink name="lv_text_flag_t" />. |
| `text_length` | Number of characters to render (0 means render until `\\0`). |
| `text_local` | Set to 1 to allocate a buffer and copy the text. |
| `text_static` | Indicates `text` is constant and its pointer can be cached. |
| `hint` | Pointer to externally stored data to speed up rendering. See <ApiLink name="lv_draw_label_hint_t" />. |

Functions for text drawing:

- <ApiLink name="lv_draw_label_dsc_init" display="lv_draw_label_dsc_init(&dsc)" /> initializes a label draw descriptor.
- <ApiLink name="lv_draw_label" display="lv_draw_label(layer, &dsc, area)" /> creates a task to render text in an area.
- <ApiLink name="lv_draw_character" display="lv_draw_character(layer, &dsc, point, unicode_letter)" /> creates a task to
  draw a character at a specific point.
- <ApiLink name="lv_draw_task_get_label_dsc" display="lv_draw_task_get_label_dsc(draw_task)" /> retrieves the label descriptor from a task.

For character-specific drawing in draw units, use
<ApiLink name="lv_draw_label_iterate_characters" display="lv_draw_label_iterate_characters(draw_unit, draw_dsc, area, callback)" />.
This iterates through all characters, calculates their positions, and calls the
callback for rendering each character.  For callback details, see
<ApiLink name="lv_draw_glyph_cb_t" />.

<LvglExample name="lv_example_canvas_4" path="widgets/canvas/lv_example_canvas_4" />

<LvglExample name="lv_example_style_8" path="styles/lv_example_style_8" />

## Arc Draw Descriptor

The <ApiLink name="lv_draw_arc_dsc_t" /> arc descriptor defines arc rendering with
these fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `color` | Arc color. |
| `img_src` | Image source for the arc, or `NULL` if unused. |
| `width` | Arc thickness. |
| `start_angle` | Starting angle in degrees (e.g., 0° is 3 o'clock, 90° is 6 o'clock). |
| `end_angle` | Ending angle. |
| `center` | Arc center point. |
| `radius` | Arc radius. |
| `opa` | Arc opacity (0--255). |
| `rounded` | Rounds the arc ends. |

Functions for arc drawing:

- <ApiLink name="lv_draw_arc_dsc_init" display="lv_draw_arc_dsc_init(&dsc)" /> initializes an arc descriptor.
- <ApiLink name="lv_draw_arc" display="lv_draw_arc(layer, &dsc)" /> creates a task to render an arc.
- <ApiLink name="lv_draw_task_get_arc_dsc" display="lv_draw_task_get_arc_dsc(draw_task)" /> retrieves arc descriptor from task.

<LvglExample name="lv_example_canvas_5" path="widgets/canvas/lv_example_canvas_5" />

<LvglExample name="lv_example_style_7" path="styles/lv_example_style_7" />

## Line Draw Descriptor

The <ApiLink name="lv_draw_line_dsc_t" /> line descriptor defines line rendering with
these fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `p1` | First point of line (supports floating-point coordinates). Ignored if `points` are set. |
| `p2` | Second point of line (supports floating-point coordinates). Ignored if `points` are set. |
| `points` | Array of points to draw. |
| `point_cnt` | Number of points in `points` |
| `color` | Line color. |
| `width` | Line thickness. |
| `opa` | Line opacity (0--255). |
| `dash_width` | Length of dashes (0 means no dashes --- a continuous line). |
| `dash_gap` | Length of gaps between dashes (0 means no gaps --- a continuous line). |
| `round_start` | Rounds the line start. |
| `round_end` | Rounds the line end. |
| `raw_end` | Set to 1 to skip end calculations if they are unnecessary. |

If a large amount of points needs to be rendered it's recommended to use `points`
instead of `p1` and `p2` as it avoids creating many draw tasks.

Functions for line drawing:

- <ApiLink name="lv_draw_line_dsc_init" display="lv_draw_line_dsc_init(&dsc)" /> initializes a line descriptor.
- <ApiLink name="lv_draw_line" display="lv_draw_line(layer, &dsc)" /> creates a task to draw a line.
- <ApiLink name="lv_draw_task_get_line_dsc" display="lv_draw_task_get_line_dsc(draw_task)" /> retrieves line descriptor.
- <ApiLink name="lv_draw_line_iterate" display="lv_draw_line_iterate(draw_task, dsc, callback)" /> is a helper function
  to call a callback which draws a line between two points. This way it doesn't matter if
  `p1, p2` or `points` were used as it calls the `callback` as needed.

<LvglExample name="lv_example_canvas_7" path="widgets/canvas/lv_example_canvas_7" />

<LvglExample name="lv_example_style_9" path="styles/lv_example_style_9" />

## Triangle Draw Descriptor

Triangles are defined by <ApiLink name="lv_draw_triangle_dsc_t" />, which includes:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `p[3]` | 3 points for the triangle's vertices. |
| `color` | Triangle color. |
| `opa` | Triangle opacity. |
| `grad` | Gradient options. If `grad.dir` is not <ApiLink name="LV_GRAD_DIR_NONE" />, the `color` field is ignored. The `opa` field adjusts overall opacity. |

Functions for triangle drawing:

- <ApiLink name="lv_draw_triangle_dsc_init" display="lv_draw_triangle_dsc_init(&dsc)" /> initializes a triangle descriptor.
- <ApiLink name="lv_draw_triangle" display="lv_draw_triangle(layer, &dsc)" /> creates a task to draw a triangle.
- <ApiLink name="lv_draw_task_get_triangle_dsc" display="lv_draw_task_get_triangle_dsc(draw_task)" /> retrieves triangle descriptor.

<LvglExample name="lv_example_canvas_9" path="widgets/canvas/lv_example_canvas_9" />

## Blur Draw Descriptor

Blur is defined by <ApiLink name="lv_draw_blur_dsc_t" />, which includes:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `blur_radius` | The radius of the blur. |
| `corner_radius` | The radius of the corners. |
| `quality` | Tells whether to prefer speed or quality. |

Functions for blur drawing:

- <ApiLink name="lv_draw_blur_dsc_init" display="lv_draw_blur_dsc_init(&dsc)" /> initializes a blur descriptor.
- <ApiLink name="lv_draw_blur" display="lv_draw_blur(layer, &dsc, area)" /> creates a task to blur an area.
- <ApiLink name="lv_draw_task_get_blur_dsc" display="lv_draw_task_get_blur_dsc(draw_task)" /> retrieves blur descriptor.

<LvglExample name="lv_example_canvas_10" path="widgets/canvas/lv_example_canvas_10" />

## Drop Shadow Draw Descriptor

Unlike Box shadow, the Drop shadow can be applied for any widgets and parts.
For example a Label, the Arc's Indicator, an ARGB image, Lines of a chart, etc.

The Drop shadow doesn't have its own draw descriptor but it's part of the base
descriptor. This way before rendering anything LVGL can create a new layer with
A8 color format, render the shape there, blur the layer, and finally blend the
blurred layer with an offset.

Creating a layer requires `width x height` bytes of memory. This memory is used only
temporarily, so in most of the cases if multiple widgets have drop shadow, only one
layer is active  and using memory at a time.

The properties are stored in `draw_dsc.base.drop_shadow_*`. It includes the
following fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `drop_shadow_opa` | Opacity (0--255 range). Values like `LV_OPA_TRANSP`, `LV_OPA_10`, etc., can also be used. If 0, the drop shadow won't be rendered |
| `drop_shadow_color` | Drop shadow color. |
| `drop_shadow_radius` | The blur radius of the drop shadow. |
| `drop_shadow_ofs_x` | Horizontal offset. |
| `drop_shadow_ofs_y` | Vertical offset. |

## Masking Operation

There are several options to mask parts of a layer, Widget, or drawing:

1. **Radius of Rectangles**:
   Set the `radius` style property or the `radius` in the draw descriptors.  This
   creates rounded rectangles, borders, outlines, etc..  However, the content of
   subsequent renderings will not be masked out in the corners.
2. **Clip Radius of Images**:
   Similar to rectangles, images can also be rendered with a `radius`.  Since
   layer drawing and image drawing are handled the same way, this works for
   layers as well.
   
   You can draw various content on a layer and then render the layer with a
   `clip_radius`, masking out all the content on the corners.
3. **Rectangle Mask Draw Task**:
   A special Draw Task can mask out a rectangle from a layer by setting the alpha
   channel of certain pixels to 0.  To achieve this:
   
   - Create an <ApiLink name="lv_draw_mask_rect_dsc_t" /> descriptor.
   - Set `area`, `radius`, and `keep_outside` parameters. If
     `keep_outside` is set to 1, areas outside of `area` remain unchanged.
     Otherwise, they are cleared.
   - Call <ApiLink name="lv_draw_mask_rect" display="lv_draw_mask_rect(layer, &dsc)" />.
   
   Note: The layer must have a color format with an alpha channel, typically
   <ApiLink name="LV_COLOR_FORMAT_ARGB8888" />.
   
   In most cases, the *"Clip Radius of Images"* method is better because it
   blends the layer with a radius mask on the fly, avoiding a dedicated masking
   step. However, the *"Rectangle Mask Draw Task"* is useful when multiple areas
   need clearing or when the area to be masked differs from the layer area.
4. **Clip Corner Style Property**:
   Enabling `..._style_clip_corner` in a local or global style allows LVGL to
   create a layer for the top and bottom corner areas of a Widget.  It renders the
   children there and blends it by setting `clip_radius` to the layer.
5. **Bitmap Masking for Images**:
   Using `..._style_bitmap_mask` or `bitmap_mask` in
   <ApiLink name="lv_draw_image_dsc_t" /> allows setting an A8 or L8 image as a mask
   for an image/layer during blending.
   
   - Limitation:  The mask always aligns to the center, and only one bitmap mask can
     be used for an image/layer.
   - When `..._style_bitmap_mask` is used, LVGL automatically creates a layer,
     renders the Widgets there, and applies the bitmap mask during blending.
   - Alternatively, the `bitmap_mask` property in the draw descriptor can be
     used directly for image drawing.
   
   By using the Canvas Widget with an <ApiLink name="LV_COLOR_FORMAT_L8" /> buffer,
   bitmap masks can be rendered dynamically.
