## Mirroring a Display

To mirror the image of a display to another display, you don't need to use
multi-display support. Just transfer the buffer received in the first display's
[Flush Callback](/main-modules/display/setup) to the other display as well.

## Splitting an Image

You can create a larger virtual display from an array of smaller ones.
You can create it by:

1. setting the resolution of the displays to the large display's resolution;
2. in [Flush Callback](/main-modules/display/setup), truncate and modify the `area` parameter for each display; and
3. send the buffer's content to each real display with the truncated area.
