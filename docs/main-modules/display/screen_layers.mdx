---

When an `lv_display_t` object is created, 4 permanent [Screens](/common-widget-features/screens) that
facilitate layering are created and attached to it.

1. Bottom Layer       (below Active Screen, transparent, not scroll-able, but click-able)
2. [Active Screen](/common-widget-features/screens)
3. Top Layer          (above Active Screen, transparent and neither scroll-able nor click-able)
4. System Layer       (above Top Layer, transparent and neither scroll-able nor click-able)

1, 3 and 4 are independent of the [Active Screen](/common-widget-features/screens) and they will be shown (if
they contain anything that is visible) regardless of which screen is the
[Active Screen](/common-widget-features/screens).

<Callout type="info">
For the bottom layer to be visible, the Active Screen's background has to be
at least partially, if not fully, transparent.
</Callout>

You can get pointers to each of these screens on the [Default Display](/main-modules/display/setup) by using
(respectively):

- <ApiLink name="lv_screen_active" />,
- <ApiLink name="lv_layer_top" />,
- <ApiLink name="lv_layer_sys" />, and
- <ApiLink name="lv_layer_bottom" />.

You can get pointers to each of these screens on a specified display by using
(respectively):

- <ApiLink name="lv_display_get_screen_active" display="lv_display_get_screen_active(disp)" />,
- <ApiLink name="lv_display_get_layer_top" display="lv_display_get_layer_top(disp)" />,
- <ApiLink name="lv_display_get_layer_sys" display="lv_display_get_layer_sys(disp)" />, and
- <ApiLink name="lv_display_get_layer_bottom" display="lv_display_get_layer_bottom(disp)" />.

To set a Screen you create to be the [Active Screen](/common-widget-features/screens), call
<ApiLink name="lv_screen_load" /> or <ApiLink name="lv_screen_load_anim" />.

Calling <ApiLink name="lv_display_get_screen_loading" display="lv_display_get_screen_loading(disp)" /> will return the screen that is
being loaded. A Screen is considered "being loaded" until the loading animation finishes.
If no Screen is being loaded, this function will return `NULL`.

## Top and System Layers

LVGL uses the Top Layer and System Layer to empower you to ensure that certain
[All Widgets](/widgets) are *always* on top of other layers.

You can add "pop-up windows" to the *Top Layer* freely.  The Top Layer was meant to
be used to create Widgets that are visible on all Screens shown on a Display.  But,
the *System Layer* is intended for system-level things (e.g. mouse cursor will be
placed there with <ApiLink name="lv_indev_set_cursor" />).

These layers work like any other Widget, meaning they have styles, and any kind of
Widgets can be created in them.

<Callout type="info">
While the Top Layer and System Layer are created by their owning [Display (lv_display)](/main-modules/display)
as not scroll-able and not click-able, these behaviors can be overridden the same
as any other Widget by using <ApiLink name="lv_obj_set_scrollbar_mode" display="lv_obj_set_scrollbar_mode(scr1, LV_SCROLLBAR_MODE_xxx)" />
and <ApiLink name="lv_obj_add_flag" display="lv_obj_add_flag(scr1, LV_OBJ_FLAG_CLICKABLE)" /> respectively.
</Callout>

If the <ApiLink name="LV_OBJ_FLAG_CLICKABLE" /> flag is set on the Top Layer, then it will
absorb all user clicks and acts as a modal Widget.

```c
lv_obj_add_flag(lv_layer_top(), LV_OBJ_FLAG_CLICKABLE);
```

## Bottom Layer

Similar to the Top- and System Layers, the Bottom Layer is also the full size of the
Display, but it is located below the [Active Screen](/common-widget-features/screens).  It's visible only if the
Active Screen's background opacity is &lt; 255.
