<hr />

**libjpeg-turbo** is an LVGL interface to the libjpeg-turbo library --- a JPEG image
codec that uses SIMD instructions to accelerate baseline JPEG compression and
decompression on x86, x86-64, Arm, PowerPC, and MIPS systems, as well as progressive
JPEG compression on x86, x86-64, and Arm systems.

On such systems, libjpeg-turbo is generally 2-6x as fast as libjpeg, all else being
equal.

For a detailed introduction, see:  https://libjpeg-turbo.org .

Library source:  https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo

## Install

```bash
sudo apt install libjpeg-turbo8-dev
```

## Adding  libjpeg-turbo to Your Project

Cmake:

```cmake
find_package(JPEG REQUIRED)
include_directories(${JPEG_INCLUDE_DIR})
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE ${JPEG_LIBRARIES})
```

## Usage

Set <ApiLink name="LV_USE_LIBJPEG_TURBO" /> in `lv_conf.h` to `1`.

See the examples below.

It should be noted that each image decoded needs to consume:

image width × image height × 3

bytes of RAM, and it needs to be combined with the [Image Caching](/main-modules/images/caching)
feature to ensure that the memory usage is within a reasonable range.

## Example

### Load a JPG image

<LvglExample name="lv_example_libjpeg_turbo_1" path="libs/libjpeg_turbo/lv_example_libjpeg_turbo_1" />

## API

<ApiLinkList items={["lv_libjpeg_turbo"]} />
