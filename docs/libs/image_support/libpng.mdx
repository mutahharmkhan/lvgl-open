<br />

<hr />

**libpng** is an LVGL interface to the official PNG reference library, which
supports almost all PNG features, is extensible, and has been extensively tested for
over 28 years.

For a detailed introduction, see:  http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html .

## Install

```bash
sudo apt install libpng-dev
```

## Adding libpng to Your Project

Cmake:

```cmake
find_package(PNG REQUIRED)
include_directories(${PNG_INCLUDE_DIR})
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE ${PNG_LIBRARIES})
```

## Usage

Set <ApiLink name="LV_USE_LIBPNG" /> in `lv_conf.h` to `1`.

See the examples below.

It should be noted that each image of this decoder needs to consume

width × height × 4

bytes of RAM, and it needs to be combined with the [Image Caching](/main-modules/images/caching) feature to
ensure that the memory usage is within a reasonable range. The decoded image is
stored in RGBA pixel format.

## Example

### Open a PNG image from file and variable

<LvglExample name="lv_example_libpng_1" path="libs/libpng/lv_example_libpng_1" />

## API

<ApiLinkList items={["lv_libpng"]} />
