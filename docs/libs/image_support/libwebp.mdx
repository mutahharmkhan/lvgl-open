**libwebp** is an LVGL interface to the WebP image format --- a modern image format that provides superior lossless and lossy compression for images on the web. WebP offers:

- Smaller file sizes compared to JPEG and PNG
- Lossy compression with transparency
- Lossless compression
- Animation support (not yet supported in the LVGL integration)

For more information, see: https://developers.google.com/speed/webp

Library source: https://github.com/webmproject/libwebp

## Install

```bash
# Linux
sudo apt install libwebp-dev
# macOS
brew install webp
```

## Adding libwebp to Your Project

CMake configuration:

```cmake
find_package(PkgConfig REQUIRED)
pkg_check_modules(WebP REQUIRED libwebp)
include_directories(${WebP_INCLUDEDIR})
target_link_libraries(main ${WebP_LINK_LIBRARIES})
```

## Usage

Set <ApiLink name="LV_USE_LIBWEBP" /> in `lv_conf.h` to `1`.

Memory requirements for WebP images:

- Lossy WebP: width × height × 4 bytes (ARGB8888 format)
- Lossless WebP: width × height × 4 bytes (ARGB8888 format)

For optimal memory usage, combine with LVGL's [Image Caching](/main-modules/images/caching) feature.

## Example

### Open a WEBP image from file and variable

<LvglExample name="lv_example_libwebp_1" path="libs/libwebp/lv_example_libwebp_1" />

## API

<ApiLinkList items={["lv_libwebp"]} />
