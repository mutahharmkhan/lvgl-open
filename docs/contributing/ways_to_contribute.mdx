Mid- and large-scale issues are discussed in [Feature Planning](https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=feat-planning.yml) issues.

An issue can be developed when all the questions in the issue template are answered and there are no objection from any core member.

We are using GitHub labels to show the state and attributes of the issues and Pull requests.
If you are looking for contribution opportunities you can [Filter for these labels](https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl/labels) :

- `Simple`: Good choice to get started with an LVGL contribution
- `PR needed`: We investigated the issue but it still needs to be implemented
- `Review needed`: A Pull request is opened and it needs review/testing
